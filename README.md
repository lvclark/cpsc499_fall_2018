# Computer Programming Fundamentals and Bioinformatics in R

This repository contains materials from a course that I taught in the
Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign in the fall of 2018.  I won't be teaching the course anymore
since I am changing jobs, but I wanted to make the materials available.

Every week there was a Tuesday lecture (supplied as a PDF, often with R files
from the live coding that I did in class) and a Thursday lab (supplied as HTML
and Rmd files).

I'm not redistributing genome sequence and annotation files in this repository
since I'm pretty sure I don't have the rights to do so, but all are available
on [Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html).  You will need
to make a free account there.  Then select the appropriate organism and go to
"Bulk Data" to download the files.

HTML files won't display nicely directly from GitHub.  I recommend downloading
the repository to your own computer.  Then, simply double-click an HTML file
to view it in your browser.

In several cases, demo data come from a yield trial of *Miscanthus sinensis*:

## Other resources for learning R

[Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is an interactive tutorial that you can run
right from RStudio.

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) run two-day workshops on a variety
of coding and data analysis topics.  We have a very active team at UIUC who
run workshops regularly, or if you are at another institution you can put in
a request for a workshop.

I am currently producing some
[YouTube videos on coding with R and Python](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyeu245nwXnUDoxvcBPqVg?view_as=subscriber)
as part of an NSF project.
